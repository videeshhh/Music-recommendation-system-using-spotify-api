#  Music Recommendation System using Spotify API & KNN

This project is a **smart, content-based music recommendation system** that leverages **machine learning (KNN)** and **Spotify‚Äôs Web API** to recommend songs similar to a user-selected track and also download cover real time. It suggests similar songs based on **audio features** and **engineered traits**, while dynamically fetching real-time **album covers and metadata** from Spotify.

Although Spotify doesn‚Äôt allow direct audio playback via API, the system provides highly accurate recommendations and a visually rich experience with cover art, artist names, and genres. üé®üéß

##  Key Features

-  **ML-Powered Music Recommender** using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
-  Complete **EDA & Feature Engineering** pipeline
-  **Real-time album cover fetching** via Spotify Web API
-  Uses **preprocessed music dataset** with rich audio features
-  Web interface powered by Flask with HTML templates
-  No playback ‚Äì **Spotify playback is restricted via API**
-  Responsive results UI built with **`index.html`** and **`recommended.html`**

##  How It Works ‚Äì End-to-End Workflow

###  Step 1: Data Collection & Cleaning

- A fixed CSV dataset containing songs with Spotify audio features is used.
- Features include:
  - `danceability`, `energy`, `acousticness`, `valence`, `tempo`, `loudness`, `instrumentalness`, etc.

###  Step 2: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- Visualize genre distributions, feature correlations, and tempo ranges.
- Identify outliers, missing values, and scale inconsistencies.

###  Step 3: Feature Engineering

- Create custom features:
  - **Mood Score** = `valence * energy`
  - **Tempo Clusters** ‚Äì bucket songs into rhythmic categories
  - **Z-score scaling** or **StandardScaler** used for normalization

###  Step 4: Model Training

- Train a **KNN model** (`scikit-learn`) on scaled numerical features
- Model learns to identify "neighborhoods" of similar songs

###  Step 5: Prediction

- On input (song name), we:
  - Search the song in the dataset
  - Extract its feature vector
  - Use **KNN** to find `n` closest songs in feature space

###  Step 6: Spotify API Integration

- Use the `spotipy` library to:
  - Search for tracks by name and artist
  - Fetch:
    - Track ID
    - Artist name
    - Album name
    - **Album cover image (live!)**

>  **Playback Note**: Spotify does not allow playing full or preview audio via the Web API without using embedded players or SDKs.
